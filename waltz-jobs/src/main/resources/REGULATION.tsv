1000		BCBS 239	BCBS 239 is the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's regulation number 239. The subject title of the regulation is: Principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting.
1100	1000	Overarching governance and infrastructure	"A bank should have in place a strong governance framework, risk data architecture and IT infrastructure. These are preconditions to ensure compliance with the other Principles included in this document. In particular, a bank’s board should oversee senior management’s ownership of implementing all the risk data aggregation and risk reporting principles and the strategy to meet them within a timeframe agreed with their supervisors. "
1200	1000	Risk data aggregation capabilities	"Banks should develop and maintain strong risk data aggregation capabilities to ensure that risk management reports reflect the risks in a reliable way (ie meeting data aggregation expectations is necessary to meet reporting expectations). Compliance with these Principles should not be at the expense of each other. These risk data aggregation capabilities should meet all Principles below simultaneously in accordance with paragraph 22 of this document. "
1300	1000	Risk reporting practices	"Accurate, complete and timely data is a foundation for effective risk management. However, data alone does not guarantee that the board and senior management will receive appropriate information to make effective decisions about risk. To manage risk effectively, the right information needs to be presented to the right people at the right time. Risk reports based on risk data should be accurate, clear and complete. They should contain the correct content and be presented to the appropriate decision-makers in a time that allows for an appropriate response. To effectively achieve their objectives, risk reports should comply with the following principles. Compliance with these principles should not be at the expense of each other in accordance with paragraph 22 of this document. "
1400	1000	Supervisory review, tools and cooperation	"Supervisors will have an important role to play in monitoring and providing incentives for a bank’s implementation of, and ongoing compliance with the Principles. They should also review compliance with the Principles across banks to determine whether the Principles themselves are achieving their desired outcome and whether further enhancements are required. "
1110	1100	Governance	Principle 1 Governance – A bank’s risk data aggregation capabilities and risk reporting practices should be subject to strong governance arrangements consistent with other principles and guidance established by the Basel Committee.
1120	1100	Data architecture and IT infrastructure	Principle 2 Data architecture and IT infrastructure – A bank should design, build and maintain data architecture and IT infrastructure which fully supports its risk data aggregation capabilities and risk reporting practices not only in normal times but also during times of stress or crisis, while still meeting the other Principles.
1210	1200	Accuracy and integrity	Principle 3 Accuracy and Integrity – A bank should be able to generate accurate and reliable risk data to meet normal and stress/crisis reporting accuracy requirements. Data should be aggregated on a largely automated basis so as to minimise the probability of errors. A high level explanation for each principle can be found in Annex 2 of the legislation.[5]
1220	1200	Completeness	Principle 4 Completeness – A bank should be able to capture and aggregate all material risk data across the banking group. Data should be available by business line, legal entity, asset type, industry, region and other groupings, as relevant for the risk in question, that permit identifying and reporting risk exposures, concentrations and emerging risks.
1230	1200	Timeliness	Principle 5 Timeliness – A bank should be able to generate aggregate and up-to-date risk data in a timely manner while also meeting the principles relating to accuracy and integrity, completeness and adaptability. The precise timing will depend upon the nature and potential volatility of the risk being measured as well as its criticality to the overall risk profile of the bank. The precise timing will also depend on the bank-specific frequency requirements for risk management reporting, under both normal and stress/crisis situations, set based on the characteristics and overall risk profile of the bank.
1240	1200	Adaptability	Principle 6 Adaptability – A bank should be able to generate aggregate risk data to meet a broad range of on-demand, ad hoc risk management reporting requests, including requests during stress/crisis situations, requests due to changing internal needs and requests to meet supervisory queries.
1310	1300	Accuracy	Principle 7 Accuracy - Risk management reports should accurately and precisely convey aggregated risk data and reflect risk in an exact manner. Reports should be reconciled and validated.
1320	1300	Comprehensiveness	Principle 8 Comprehensiveness - Risk management reports should cover all material risk areas within the organisation. The depth and scope of these reports should be consistent with the size and complexity of the bank’s operations and risk profile, as well as the requirements of the recipients.
1330	1300	Clarity and usefulness	Principle 9 Clarity and usefulness - Risk management reports should communicate information in a clear and concise manner. Reports should be easy to understand yet comprehensive enough to facilitate informed decision-making. Reports should include an appropriate balance between risk data, analysis and interpretation, and qualitative explanations. Reports should include meaningful information tailored to the needs of the recipients.
1340	1300	Frequency	Principle 10 Frequency - The board and senior management (or other recipients as appropriate) should set the frequency of risk management report production and distribution. Frequency requirements should reflect the needs of the recipients, the nature of the risk reported, and the speed at which the risk can change, as well as the importance of reports in contributing to sound risk management and effective and efficient decision-making across the bank. The frequency of reports should be increased during times of stress/crisis.
1350	1300	Distribution	Principle 11 Distribution - Risk management reports should be distributed to the relevant parties and while ensuring confidentiality is maintained.
1410	1400	Review	Principle 12 Review - Supervisors should periodically review and evaluate a bank’s compliance with the eleven Principles above.
1420	1400	Remedial actions and supervisory measures	Principle 13 Remedial actions and supervisory measures - Supervisors should have and use the appropriate tools and resources to require effective and timely remedial action by a bank to address deficiencies in its risk data aggregation capabilities and risk reporting practices. Supervisors should have the ability to use a range of tools, including Pillar 2.
1430	1400	Home/host cooperation	Principle 14 Home/host cooperation - Supervisors should cooperate with relevant supervisors in other jurisdictions regarding the supervision and review of the Principles, and the implementation of any remedial action if necessary.
