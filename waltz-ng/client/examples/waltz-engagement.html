        <h4>Adoption:</h4>
        <p>
            During early adoption phases (whilst the product approaches a v1.0 release)
            engagement will be via consultancy arrangements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the early adoption period lapses (~ 6-12 months) the software will transition to a support
            model + additional consultancy / development as required.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h4>Shared Source Model:</h4>
        <p>
            During early adoption and subsequent support phases (read) access to the source code will be provided
            via GitHub.  Organizations will be free to copy and/or fork the code (but not resell derivative work),
            however we will encourage modifications to be submitted back to the repository for inclusion in subsequent
            releases.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h4>Releases:</h4>
        <p>
            Regular releases (initially monthly) will be made available via the GitHub repository along with release
            notes, migration scripts etc.
        </p>
