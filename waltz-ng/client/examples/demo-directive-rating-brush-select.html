        The <q>waltz-rating-brush-select</q> directive provides the user with a selection mechanism to choose
        a rating level.

    <waltz-section name="Demo">
        <waltz-rating-brush-select selected="ctrl.selected"
                                   on-select="ctrl.onSelect"></waltz-rating-brush-select>
    </waltz-section>

    <waltz-section name="Example Code">
        <pre>
&lt;waltz-rating-brush-select selected="ctrl.selected"
                           on-select="ctrl.onSelect">&lt;/waltz-rating-brush-select>
        </pre>

        The control is does not alter the given selected value, instead it calls back on the
        given <code>on-select</code> function.  This should update the <code>selected</code>
        variable (or reject etc).
