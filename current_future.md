- Target Marker
    - Wide range of users
    - Low footprint
    - ease of use
    - Low configuration (because it's opinionated)



## Current


### Application
  - Basic Info (overall investment status, UBR etc)
  - App Capabilities
  - w/ Ratings per area
    - user editable
  - Logical Data Flows w/ data categories/classes
    - user editable
  - Cost Summaries
  - Change Initiatives (via groups)
  - Technologies
    - Servers
    - (Databases / Software awaiting source data)
  - Complexity Scores (derived)

### Aggregate views
  - By Capability
  - By Organisational Unit (ubr)
  - By Person (incl. all reportees)
  - By Business Process (GM Critical Processes)
  - By Custom group (user defined)

### Aggregate views contain
  - Associated Apps
  - Data flow overview (customisable)
  - Complexity breakdown
  - Asset Cost summary
  - Technology summary

### All Main entities (Apps, Org Units, Capabilities etc)
  - Association of people to entities
  - Bookmarks describing entity
  - Audited

### Org Unit Specific
  - End User Application associations (via c7 ownership)
  - Authoritative Data Sources
    - inherited by sub Org Units

### Describe portfolio changes over time
  - associated 
    - to change initiatives
    - to entities
  - describing
    - application capability rating changes
    - retirements
    - application data flow changes
    - *transitively show impact on other entities*

### App Capability ratings over a set of hierarchical items
  - provides a multi dimensional view of an applications role
    - e.g. products definitions
    - lines of business
    - region

### Ad hoc Surveys
  - Target defined subset of estate
  - reduce duplication of effort to acquire data
    - increase exposure of this data

### Logical Flows tied to physical characteristics
  - Transport mechanisms
  - file formats
  - *schedules, SLA/OLA definitions*

### Diagram Editor
  - Diagramming tool
    - understands domain entities and their relationships
    - indexable, customisable rendering
    - *replace nav-aids*

### Insights
  - segregation of duty
    - through understanding relationships between people, applications and capabilities
  - technology risk exposure
    - outdated/non-strategic tech usage

### Cleanup tasks
  - notification of data discrepancies / challenges

### Capability Model Management
  - *migrate/edit capabilities*

### Anonymised Industry ratings
  - *requires large waltz user base*
